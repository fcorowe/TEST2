# debiasR package vignettes

This folder contains the package-facing Quarto vignettes for `debiasR`.
They are intended to be built and installed with the package, and should stay
focused on stable user workflows rather than workshop planning, exploratory
method testing, or rendered preview artifacts.

The running examples use the optional `debiasRdata` package at LAD scale by
default. Vignettes load bounded empirical inputs through `_common.R` so
examples can render quickly and exit cleanly when the optional data package is
not installed.

## Structure

1. `v02-why-this-matters.qmd`
2. `v03-getting-set-up.qmd`
3. `v04-measuring-coverage-bias.qmd`
4. `v05-identifying-and-explaining-bias.qmd`
5. `v06-adjusting-biases.qmd`
6. `v07-validation.qmd`
7. `v09-advanced-bayesian-adjustment.qmd`

Supporting package-vignette assets belong in:

- `figures/`
- `data/`
- `exercises/`

Longer workshop, teaching, method-testing notebooks, and draft articles that
are not ready for the public pkgdown index live outside the package vignette
tree in `notes/`. The draft data article is currently kept at
`notes/project-management/v08-data-draft.qmd`.

Generated render artifacts such as `.html`, extracted `.R`, `.knit.md`,
`.rmarkdown`, `.quarto/`, `*_files/`, and `.quarto_ipynb` files should not be
committed from this folder.
